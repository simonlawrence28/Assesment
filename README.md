I designed the page initially on paper to givemyself a clear format in my mind to make the coding process smoother. 
I liked the idea of a background image and wanted a colour of header that matched the sky
I found coding the dropbox hard and getting the map to work
I chose a harder type of menu tap which took more time than intended but i am happy with the results
